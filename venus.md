# Venus Jungle Safari

Underneath the purple vegetation that makes up Venus' lush forests I laid prone in the mud.
All manner of alien insects crawled about my person while I tried to remain still. At any moment the lethal Venusian Lynx
would make its way out of the brush and into my line of sight. I was perched, ready with the most advanced camera I
could get my hands on. It would collect a full 3D scan of the elusive Lynx and transmit it back to my orbital cruiser.

However, fate had other plans for me on this fine, if not muddy, day. One instant I was lying in the mud, the next I was 
whisked into the air by an unknown force. I kept my wits about me and was able to reach my bush knife, which I used to
hack away my pack before I got too high in the air. The fall was not pleasant but the dense vegetation of the jungle 
cushioned my landing.

I laid on my back and looked up to see mysterious winged beast heading East across the sky with my pack. No matter, I
still had the 3D camera slung about my neck, and after a moment of reorienting myself I was back on my feet and searching
once more for the Venusian Lynx. After searching for my previous hiding spot for the better part of an hour, I came to
the realization that I was woefully lost. 

The sun was beginning to set by the time I decided to give up the goose, or rather, the Lynx. My pack had all of my 
camping gear, and I could not hope to survive the hostile nocturnal predators without it. I activated my distress beacon
and within minutes my trusty AI assistant Chad had picked me up in the cruiser and was flying us back into orbit.

After a divine shower and shave, I found myself reflecting in my cryo-sleep pod. While I had not attained a 3D scan of 
the Venusian Lynx, I had still ended the day with something far more valuable: My life. Dear reader, appreciate every 
moment you have in this wondrous galaxy of ours.
