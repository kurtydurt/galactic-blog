# Ice Fishing on Europa

As I found myself huddled beneath the tiny thermal tarp, I wondered whether I had finally lost it.
Here I was in negative 50 degree temperatures, not to mention the scathing wind, chasing a myth.
The Europan Hammerhead has only been seen on blurred datalogs and most of the information
about the beast comes from local legend. 

While I was questioning my own mind, I was rudely interrupted by a savage tug on my line. I nearly
lost control of my titanium alloy fishing rod as I surged from under the tarp and towards the edge of 
my carefully carved (using my trusty heat laser) fishing hole. Luckily I was able to regain control, but now
I was unprotected from Europa's freezing winds.

Never one to back down from the elements, I tightened my grip on the fishing rod and began to crank. 
Each rotation of the reel took Herculean effort as I heaved the infernal sea creature attached to the end of my line
ever closer.

With the cold closing in and my strength quickly draining, I surely would have failed without my military grade
exoskeleton. But luck and preparation were on my side dear reader, and I prevailed.
With one final tug I wrested the creature from the Europan depths.

With the alien beast in full view I could that I had done it, the Europan Hammerhead was mine! I shall spare you the
grisly details, but soon I found myself back aboard my orbital cruiser, dining on the finest Sea Steak that not even
money could buy. It was prepared by my trusty AI assistant Chad of course. Seared to a perfect medium rare.

Dear reader, let this be a lesson that all things truly worth having take effort.
