# About The Galactic Traveler

The Galactic Traveler is the Milky Way's premier travel blog, detailing excursions
from all across not only our home solar system, but the entire galaxy!

The Galactic Traveler has been around since the inception of commercial space travel and has proudly provided
inspiration and entertainment to adventurous humans for over 100 years.

Author and founder Reginald Lancaster is still just as prolific as ever, maintaining his youth through a combination of
advanced medical treatments and frequent extended stays in cryosleep chambers during his travels.

To keep pumping out content at a steady pace, Reginald uses his advanced AI assistant, Chad GPT, to probe his brain during
cryosleep and translate his thoughts into each blog post you read here. The wonders of modern technology are truly 
astounding.
